## Project Description

I will attempt to create reactive mobile-first portfolio webpage.
As planned, I'd start with fixed positioned header containing navigation buttons that will stick to the top of the page. no matter what. Possible slight opacity editing.
I'd follow up with, smaller, banner style header, preferably animated, representing skillset I work with.
Under the header, I'd include few photos of myself with few paragraphs, if I manage to add slider to the desktop & tabled design, and preferably carousel to the mobile.
After that, follow up would be with projects from homework representation that could be edited down the line if needed.
Bottom of the page would contain contact form which I'd like to have info validation feature and mouseover fade-in contact information.
